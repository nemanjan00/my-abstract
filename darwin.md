## Darwin, that crazy bastard... 

So, what the fuck is happening in my head? 

Let's say you have some pebble and sieve. 

What does sieve do? 

It lets small sand go through and blocks bigger rocks. 

In that sense, you would say that small sand is "good at being small". 

In the same sense, people who managed to survive evolution and leave their genes are good at survival and reproduction. 

That being said, we can conclude that people mainly developed to be good at those 2 functions. 

### Another dimension of mind-fuck

If we add time to that equation, then, we can notice one more thing... 

Gens that were selected at certain points of time were selected based of that if they were good genes at THAT PARTICULAR TIME. 

That means, as a community, we still have two sets of features. 

We are split into those with genes that survived times of caves people by being strongest or by being good at avoiding conflicts.
