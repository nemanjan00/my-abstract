## Darwin, that crazy bastard... 

So, what the fuck is happening in my head? 

Let's say you have some pebble and sieve. 

What does sieve do? 

It lets small sand go through and blocks bigger rocks. 

In that sense, you would say that small sand is "good at being small". 

In the same sense, people who managed to survive evolution and leave their genes are good at survival and reproduction. 

That being said, we can conclude that people mainly developed to be good at those 2 functions.
