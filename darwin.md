## Darwin, that crazy bastard... 

So, what the fuck is happening in my head? 

Let's make our assumptions based on theory of big numbers and see for ourselves how good it fits reality. 

Let's say you have some pebble and sieve. 

What does sieve do? 

It lets small sand go through and blocks bigger rocks. 

In that sense, you would say that small sand is "good at being small". 

In the same sense, people who managed to survive evolution and leave their genes are good at survival and reproduction. 

That being said, we can conclude that people mainly developed to be good at those 2 functions. 

### Another dimension of mind-fuck

If we add time to that equation, then, we can notice one more thing... 

Gens that were selected at certain points of time were selected based of that if they were good genes at THAT PARTICULAR TIME. 

That means, as a community, we still have two sets of features. 

We are split into those with genes that survived times of caves people by being strongest or by being good at avoiding conflicts. 

### Don't genes get mixed? 

Well, we have all learned in biology that there are dominant and less dominant. 

The fact is, these genes are not dominant based on facts that they are more likely to make you survive or not but on pure chemistry. 

So, what does that mean? 

It means that genes are also preselected on their chemistry. 

Does that mean that not only good genes survive? 

Not really... 

If you randomly take small sand from sand pile, you still end up with small sand. 

Only real effect of mixing genes is that people have mixed features and it is up to them, their genes and their development to decide which genes will get expressed more than others. 

What I am saying is that you can be the one who hides or the one who fights. 

You have genes for both.
