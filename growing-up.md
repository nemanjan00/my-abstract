## Growing up

### World I was born in

As a child, I grew up in as street with a lot criminals kids. 

For someone my age, it was dangerous area to live in. 

My parents are intellectuals, hard working people... 

You could say their goal is to survive by taking well known routes. 

Me, on the other hand... I was crazy kid... 

As a 2 year old, I was laing down on women on beach, because sand is hot... 

### World I lived in

Suddenly, I changed. 

I did not have much friends. 

Since being very little, I was taught I was better than most of kids around me, because "You are a good kid. ". 

Suddenly, I felt out of control, which is something that is still in me, to a point. 

I started closing into myself. 

I was my best friend. 

I was my role-model and my parents became enemies. 

I spent most of my time disassembling my toys and trying to figure out how they worked. 

That is when I found another world. 

World where I can be god. 

World where I can make stuff do what I want... 

World that is different to one I was born inside. 

### Master of deception

I lived in one world. I was also in another world. 

How did I accomplish living in two world? 

I got very good at avoiding other people and obligations. 

So good that there were moments that I was feeling alone, but, I was anyway unknowingly avoiding people.
