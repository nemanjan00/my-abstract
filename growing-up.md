# Growing up

As a child, I grew up in as street with a lot criminals kids. 

For someone my age, it was dangerous area to live in. 

My parents are intellectuals, hard working people... 

You could say their goal is to survive by taking well known routes. 

Me, on the other hand... I was crazy kid... 

As a 2 year old, I was laing down on women on beach, because sand is hot... 

Suddenly, I changed. 

I did not have much friends. 

Since being very little, I was taught I was better than most of kids around me, because "You are a good kid. ".
