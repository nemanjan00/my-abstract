## Two moments

It was starting to rain. I started to cry. 

It was my first year on collage. I felt alone. 

Exams started. Everyone was busy. 

I did not know what to do. I laid down. 

### Moment number one

I laid there for hours and hours and thought about how I was a fucking failure. 

I did what every single one of you did at least once in a lifetime. 

I asked myself if there was was something wrong with me. 

Excuses started pouring in. 

My mind kicked in to protect me. 

Suddenly I was blaming everything and everyone. 

What I did not figure out then is that there indeed was something wrong with me. 

As any other human would do, I picked up the phone. 

Called first person I knew would comfort me. 

She was a very smart girl and a nice person. 

We talked for hours and that whole time, we were both feeling sorry for me. 

It finally struck me. 

I wanted to have sex with her. 

It all changed in one single moment. 

That is the first time in my life I figured out how strong my instincts were. 

Suddenly noting else mattered. 

I was animal looking for mating partner. 

### Moment number two
