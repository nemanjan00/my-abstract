## Two moments

It was starting to rain. I started to cry. 

It was my first year on collage. I felt alone. 

Exams started. Everyone was busy. 

I did not know what to do. I laid down. 

### Moment number one

I laid there for hours and hours and thought about how I was a fucking failure. 

I did what every single one of you did at least once in a lifetime. 

I asked myself if there was was something wrong with me. 

Excuses started pouring in. 

My mind kicked in to protect me. Suddenly I was blaiming everything and everyone. 

What I did not figure out then is that there indeed was something wrong with me. 

### Moment number two
