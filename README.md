# My Abstract

My Abstract is crazy story you are not going to believe. 

If you are not open-minded, you should most probably close it right now. 

I am just warning you, what you are about to read is not easy to process and it is not my fault if you kill yourself or die from stress. 

Our brain is built to defend us from what I figured out. 

This book is giving you chance to figure it out for yourself. 

This is story of two moments and how they changed my live and the way I see it. 

I am very fucked up and crazy person. That is what makes me and everyone around me happy.
