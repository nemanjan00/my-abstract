# My Abstract

My Abstract is crazy story you are not going to belive. 

If you are not openminded, you should most probably close it right now. 

I am just warning you, what you are about to read is not easy to process and it is not my fault if you kill yourself or die from stress. 

Our brain is built to defend us from what I figured out. 

This is story of two moments and how they changed my live and the way I see it.
