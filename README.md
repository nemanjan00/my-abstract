# My Abstract

My Abstract is crazy story you are not going to believe. 

If you are not open-minded, you should most probably close it right now. 

I am just warning you, what you are about to read is not easy to process and it is not my fault if you kill yourself or die from stress. 

Our brain is built to defend us from what I figured out. 

This book is giving you chance to figure it out for yourself. 

## Questionnaires

Before each segment of book, there will be questionnaire with questions related to that chapter. 

I want you to get a pen and paper and, before and after reading segment, write down your answers. 

Later, you can compare your answers.
