# Abstraction 

So far, we figured out our most basic drives as a beings. 

Lets say there is a small baby... 

How does it know and learn anything? 

## External abstraction

Imagine explaining blue color to a blind person. 

Can you do it? 

No, you can't. 

You can't because "blue" is just abstraction in our head. 

It is just abstraction, representation of signal from your eye that says which frequency that light is. 

With time, we collect signals from our senses, we spot patterns and create abstractions. 

### How do you recognize patterns? 

By interconnecting abstractions and assumptions. 

If you see digits, screen, speaker and microphone, your brain will find connection of all of them to a phone and you will know that it is a phone. 

On the other hand, that same set of abstractions can be connected to something else, like talk and walkie. That means that our brain is not really perfect. 

It is just good on approximating things based off previous experiences. 

Also, what can happen is that one of elements is missing. What brain is good at is predicting missing parts. 

If you for example see fire and someones hand in it, what your brain is going to do is to assume pain.
